# Simple Web Stack

## Explanation
This infrastructure consists of a single server that hosts the web server (Nginx), the application, and the MySQL database. The domain `foobar.com` is configured with a DNS record pointing to the server's IP address (`8.8.8.8`).

### Components:
- **Web server (Nginx)**: Handles HTTP requests from users.
- **Application server**: Runs the application code.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Stores the application's data.

### Issues:
- **SPOF**: If the server fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
- **Downtime during maintenance**: Restarting the server or deploying new code can cause temporary downtime.
- **Scalability**: One server may not be able to handle heavy traffic, making it difficult to scale.

## Communication
Users connect to the website via the domain `foobar.com`, which is resolved by DNS to the server's IP address, and the server responds to HTTP requests over TCP/IP.
